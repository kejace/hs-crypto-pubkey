* signature & verification functions to take a pre-computed digest
	introduce a new "DigestedMessage" type that either is a digest or a message in some different form.
	message could be a strict bytestring or lazy bytestring this way.

* ECDSA:
	Use Montgomery ladder for point multiplication, this should take care of timing attacks.
	Use Shamir's trick for better performance in verification.

* ECC ECDH & ECC ElGamal
	http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6090

* encryption scheme for ElGamal

* support for non-multiple-of-8 RSA keys.
	need to change crypto-pubkey-types to use bits instead of bytes.

* more KATs (RSA PKCS15, ElGamal, ECC points, ECDSA)

* koblitz curves : fix detection of "Added PT of order 2" is not a valid point.
